>>> GUIDES <<<<
  -> No pressure, if you are not able to 
     complete all the tasks. We can always pick up where you left off in our session. 
  -> attempt atleast one question between question 4 and 6
  -> Get to ask questions where you are stuck
  


Question 1:
----------

Create two sets of numbers and find their union, intersection, and the difference between them.
Hint: this will need set datatype
      check our last question on previous exercise'''

'''
Question 2:
----------

Write a Python program with a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list. '''

'''
Question 3: 
----------

Combine logical operators to check if a number x is between 10 and 20 or between 30 and 40.

Question 4:

Student Grading System:
-----------------------

You are creating a program to calculate and assign your grades based on your scores. The grading criteria are as follows:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: Below 60
You get a score of 93%. 
Write a Python program that will take your score as input and assign it the appropriate grade.
Hint: Use if-elif-else statements.
      Also let's give your score a variable name, right :)
      my_score = 93'''

Question 5:
----------

 Income Tax Calculation:
 -----------------------

You are building a tax calculation program to help work around your taxes easily :)
The tax rules are as follows:

If your annual income is less than or equal to €30,000, your are exempted from tax :)
If your income is between €30,001 and €50,000, you pay 10% tax.
If your income is between €50,001 and €100,000, you pay 20% tax.
If your income is over €100,000, you pay 30% tax.
Write a Python program that can help you take your income. And then calculate for you the tax to pay. '''

Question 6:
-----------

    LOAN ELIGIBILITY
    ----------------

Now you have worked on your taxes. You wanna know your eligibility for this loan that you've always wanted :)
You thought of designing a loan approval system that you can cross reference with your lending institution. 
The rules are as follows for a loan:

Your credit score should be above 650.
If the credit score is below 650, the annual income (ai) should be at least €70,000 for approval.  -> < 650 or ai >= 70k 
The loan amount should be less than or equal to 2 times the annual income.
Write a Python program that takes your credit score (which unfortunately is 500), annual income (reference previous question for this), and requested loan amount (have any value here) 
and determines whether you are eligible for a loan 

Hint: start by creating variables for the different values;
      Use if-elif-else statements.'''
